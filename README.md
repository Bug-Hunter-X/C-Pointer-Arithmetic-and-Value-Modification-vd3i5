# C Pointer Arithmetic and Value Modification

This repository contains a simple C program demonstrating pointer arithmetic and how it can be used to modify the value of a variable indirectly. The solution shows the correct implementation.  The original code is intended to highlight a potential misunderstanding regarding pointer operations in C.

## Learning Points

* Understanding pointer declaration and initialization in C
* How to dereference a pointer to access and modify the value of the pointed-to variable.
* Pointer arithmetic concepts and its use cases.
